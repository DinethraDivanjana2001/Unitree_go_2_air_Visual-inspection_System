  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n-   **Full scale range:** The scale ranges from 0 to 30.\n-   **MAJOR tick mark intervals:** The major tick marks are labeled 0, 10, 20, and 30. The interval between major marks is 10 units (e.g., 10 - 0 = 10, 20 - 10 = 10).\n-   **Minor tick mark intervals:** Between each major tick mark (e.g., 0 and 10), there are 10 subdivisions. Therefore, each minor tick mark represents (10 units / 10 subdivisions) = 1 unit.\n-   **How many subdivisions are between major marks:** 10 subdivisions.\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n-   The pointer (needle) is clearly visible.\n-   It is between the major tick mark of 10 and 20.\n-   Starting from the lower major mark of 10, the pointer is exactly aligned with the first minor tick mark after 10.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n-   Start from the lower major tick value: 10 A.\n-   Add the contribution from minor ticks: The pointer is on the 1st minor tick past 10. Since each minor tick represents 1 unit, this adds 1 * 1 unit = 1 A.\n-   Total reading: 10 A + 1 A = 11 A.\n-   The indicator is precisely on a minor tick, so no further interpolation is required.\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n-   The unit displayed on the scale is \"A\", which stands for Amperes.\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 11 A",
