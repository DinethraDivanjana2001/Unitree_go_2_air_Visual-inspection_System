  "question": "What is the reading of the ammeter",
  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n-   **Full scale range:** The scale ranges from 0 to 10.\n-   **MAJOR tick mark intervals:** The numbered tick marks are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. The interval between major tick marks is 2 units (e.g., 4 - 2 = 2).\n-   **Minor tick mark intervals:** Between any two major tick marks (e.g., between 2 and 4), there are 10 subdivisions.\n-   **Value of each minor subdivision:** Since there are 10 subdivisions between a 2-unit interval, each minor tick represents 2 units / 10 subdivisions = 0.2 units.\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n-   The red pointer is the indicator.\n-   The pointer is located between the major tick mark '2' and the major tick mark '4'.\n-   Counting from the '2' major tick mark, the pointer aligns with the 7th minor tick.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n-   Value of the lower major tick: 2.0 A\n-   Contribution from minor ticks: 7 minor ticks * 0.2 A/minor tick = 1.4 A\n-   Total Reading = 2.0 A + 1.4 A = 3.4 A\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n-   The unit displayed prominently on the scale is 'A', which stands for Amperes.\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 3.4 A",
